<h1>Last One Standing</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  This is my description, the setting is in the forest with a zombie apocalypse going on while you are trying to fend off the infected. There are two weapons present to you during your stay: a pistol and a rocket launcher. You play as a young girl which is being driven to a safehouse.  As she does so, hordes of zombies emerge and attack the Jeep she is on.  Since she’s the protagonist, she happens to carry a pistol and a rocket launcher with her. The infected attack you, which you can easily fend off with bullets and rockets. Each weapon has a cool down which forces you to switch off the the other. This rotation can allow you to plan your time with each shot. Your health decreases each time you get hit within the range of the infected if they get close to you. The hordes to get more and more stronger due to their tightly packed formation, and make the game harder. The player will use the keyboard to shoot. The game ends only if the jeep blows up.This will be a side scrolling game.There is no end to winning so….yup.
