<h1>Last One Standing</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  This is my description, the setting is in the forest with a zombie apocalypse going on while you are trying to fend off the infected. There are two weapons present to you during your stay: a pistol and a rocket launcher. You play as a young girl which is being driven to a safehouse. As she does so, hordes of zombies emerge and attack the Jeep she is on.  Since sheâ€™s the protagonist, she happens to carry a pistol and a rocket launcher with her. The infected attack you, which you can easily fend off with bullets and rockets. You can swich your weapons but clicking the left mouse button or the right mouse button. As you change your weapons it allow you to plan your time with each shot. Your health decreases each time when you collided with the zombies. So does your ammo decreases. The player will use the mouse to shoot. The game ends only if you run out of bullets and health. This will be a side scrolling game.
